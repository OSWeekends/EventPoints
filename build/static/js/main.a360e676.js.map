El curso también introduce el papel que juegan las álgebras en la programación funcional, y los dos estilos de programación algebraica principales: basados en type classes y basados en F-algebras, transformaciones naturales, tipos algebraicos de datos generalizados, etc. Durante el curso utilizaremos Scala y su fantástico ecosistema de librerías para la programación funcional, concretamente, shapeless y las librerías de type classes scalaz y cats. Con una menor relevancia, en el curso también se hará mención a la librería de pruebas Scalacheck. Para cada uno de estos tres estilos de programación, se describirán los problemas más relevantes para los que están pensados, sus abstracciones constituyentes y el soporte que ofrecen para ellos las librerías del ecosistema de Scala.\\n\\nObjetivos\\n\\nEncuadrar los tres estilos de programación estudiados durante el curso como parte del catálogo de técnicas de modularidad proporcionadas por la programación funcional\\nEntender los patrones de diseño utilizados por Cats y Scalaz en la implementación de la signatura, leyes, operaciones derivadas, instancias y sintaxis de las type classes incluidas en dichas librerías.\\nInstanciar las type classes monádicas más comunes (MonadState, MonadError, etc.) con los transformadores de mónadas correspondientes (StateT, EitherT, etc.), y entender cómo funcionan dichos transformadores.\\nEntender el papel que desempeñan las algebras en la programación funcionaln como especificaciones de DSLs, y las distintas formas de representarlas: con tipos algebraicos de datos (F-Algebras) y mediante type classes (Ojbect-algebras).\\nUtilizar tipos algebraicos de datos generalizados, transformaciones naturales y Free monads para diseñar DSLs, y saber cuándo utilizar estas representaciones en lugar de las basadas en Church encodings y álgebras de objetos.\\nEntender las diferencias entre los estilos aplicativo y monádico (es decir, imperativo), sus principales aplicaciones y el soporte que ofrecen scalaz y cats para ellos\\nEntender el concepto de representación libre (\\\"free structures\\\") y su aplicación al diseño de lenguajes aplicativos y monádicos\\nEntender el papel de las listas heterogéneas (HList) y los coproductos para abstraer la forma particular de los tipos algebraicos de datos (ADTs), y poder de esa forma implementar algoritmos genéricos que trabajen a ese nivel de abstracción (por ejemplo, para derivar automáticamente type classes). ¡Todo ello utilizando shapeless!\\nEntender la arquitectura interna de shapeless, cats y scalaz, así como las técnicas de Scala más avanzadas utilizadas en su diseño\\n¡Aprender más programación funcional por uno mismo!\\n\\nTemario\\n\\nType class libraries: Scalaz & Cats\\n\\nScalaz & Cats overview\\nType classes: Monad, MonadState, MonadError, etc.\\nMonad transformers: StateT, EitherT, etc.\\n\\n\\nAlgebras and functional programming\\n\\nF-algebras and object-algebras\\nGADTs and natural transformations\\nFree structures: free monoids and free monads\\n\\n\\nApplicative programming\\n\\nApplicative functors\\nTraversables\\nFree applicatives\\n\\n\\nDatatype generic programming\\n\\nShapeless architecture\\nHList, Coproduct and Fix\\nAutomatic type class derivation\\n\\n\\n\\nAudiencia\\nEste curso está especialmente dirigido a ti si:\\n\\nProgramadores de Scala con conocimientos intermedios de programación funcional, deseosos de mejorar su conocimiento de este paradigma y poder utilizar shapeless, scalaz, cats, y otras librerías igualmente avanzadas del ecosistema de Scala, en su código de producción\\nProgramadores con un conocimiento profundo de programación funcional, con ganas de saber cómo se aplican dichos conocimientos con Scala y su ecosistema de librerías\\n\\nMás información en ... \\nhttp://www.hablapps.com/index.html#functional-advanced-es\",\n\t\t\t\"date\":

El curso también introduce el papel que juegan las álgebras en la programación funcional, y los dos estilos de programación algebraica principales: basados en type classes y basados en F-algebras, transformaciones naturales, tipos algebraicos de datos generalizados, etc. Durante el curso utilizaremos Scala y su fantástico ecosistema de librerías para la programación funcional, concretamente, shapeless y las librerías de type classes scalaz y cats. Con una menor relevancia, en el curso también se hará mención a la librería de pruebas Scalacheck. Para cada uno de estos tres estilos de programación, se describirán los problemas más relevantes para los que están pensados, sus abstracciones constituyentes y el soporte que ofrecen para ellos las librerías del ecosistema de Scala.\\n\\nObjetivos\\n\\nEncuadrar los tres estilos de programación estudiados durante el curso como parte del catálogo de técnicas de modularidad proporcionadas por la programación funcional\\nEntender los patrones de diseño utilizados por Cats y Scalaz en la implementación de la signatura, leyes, operaciones derivadas, instancias y sintaxis de las type classes incluidas en dichas librerías.\\nInstanciar las type classes monádicas más comunes (MonadState, MonadError, etc.) con los transformadores de mónadas correspondientes (StateT, EitherT, etc.), y entender cómo funcionan dichos transformadores.\\nEntender el papel que desempeñan las algebras en la programación funcionaln como especificaciones de DSLs, y las distintas formas de representarlas: con tipos algebraicos de datos (F-Algebras) y mediante type classes (Ojbect-algebras).\\nUtilizar tipos algebraicos de datos generalizados, transformaciones naturales y Free monads para diseñar DSLs, y saber cuándo utilizar estas representaciones en lugar de las basadas en Church encodings y álgebras de objetos.\\nEntender las diferencias entre los estilos aplicativo y monádico (es decir, imperativo), sus principales aplicaciones y el soporte que ofrecen scalaz y cats para ellos\\nEntender el concepto de representación libre (\\\"free structures\\\") y su aplicación al diseño de lenguajes aplicativos y monádicos\\nEntender el papel de las listas heterogéneas (HList) y los coproductos para abstraer la forma particular de los tipos algebraicos de datos (ADTs), y poder de esa forma implementar algoritmos genéricos que trabajen a ese nivel de abstracción (por ejemplo, para derivar automáticamente type classes). ¡Todo ello utilizando shapeless!\\nEntender la arquitectura interna de shapeless, cats y scalaz, así como las técnicas de Scala más avanzadas utilizadas en su diseño\\n¡Aprender más programación funcional por uno mismo!\\n\\nTemario\\n\\nType class libraries: Scalaz & Cats\\n\\nScalaz & Cats overview\\nType classes: Monad, MonadState, MonadError, etc.\\nMonad transformers: StateT, EitherT, etc.\\n\\n\\nAlgebras and functional programming\\n\\nF-algebras and object-algebras\\nGADTs and natural transformations\\nFree structures: free monoids and free monads\\n\\n\\nApplicative programming\\n\\nApplicative functors\\nTraversables\\nFree applicatives\\n\\n\\nDatatype generic programming\\n\\nShapeless architecture\\nHList, Coproduct and Fix\\nAutomatic type class derivation\\n\\n\\n\\nAudiencia\\nEste curso está especialmente dirigido a ti si:\\n\\nProgramadores de Scala con conocimientos intermedios de programación funcional, deseosos de mejorar su conocimiento de este paradigma y poder utilizar shapeless, scalaz, cats, y otras librerías igualmente avanzadas del ecosistema de Scala, en su código de producción\\nProgramadores con un conocimiento profundo de programación funcional, con ganas de saber cómo se aplican dichos conocimientos con Scala y su ecosistema de librerías\\n\\nMás información en ... \\nhttp://www.hablapps.com/index.html#functional-advanced-es\",\n\t\t\"date\":
